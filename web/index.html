  <meta name="description" content="This project develops a cross-platform mobile and web application designed to facilitate German language acquisition for children. Built with Flutter, it targets iOS, Android, and Web platforms, ensuring a consistent user experience across diverse devices. A core architectural feature is the integration of the Gemma 3 Nano models for language processing and content generation. This on-device machine learning capability provides significant advantages:

Enhanced Data Privacy: By performing language model inferences locally, the application minimizes external data transmission, ensuring sensitive user interactions and learning patterns remain private to the device.

Robust Offline Functionality: The reliance on local Gemma 3 Nano models enables the app to operate fully without an active internet connection, supporting uninterrupted learning in various environments.

The application's design prioritizes a child-friendly interface while backend logic leverages the efficiency and compact size of the Gemma 3 Nano models to deliver engaging, personalized language learning experiences with minimal resource overhead.">
